Myself Ektha. I am in my final years of B.E. Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with VLSI honours.

In this account, you will find the Verilog related subjects

- [RISC-V Single Cycle Processor](https://github.com/EkthaReddy/RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor).
- [31 Days of Verilog Challenge](https://github.com/EkthaReddy/30-Days-of---Daily-Verilog-Programming-Challenge-) firstly opted on LinkedIn.  
- [Verilog projects](https://github.com/EkthaReddy/Verilog-projects).


### Want to know more about me ? 
Check out the linkedIn account at [www.linkedin.com/in/ekthareddy](#) for projects and certification I have completed or currently doing.

Make sure to visit the YouTube channel at [www.youtube.com/@Codopro](#) for Verilog Codes, Verilog projects and Podcasts to be a version 7.0

### Internship 

- Currently, I am doing an intership on VLSI Design at Intershala, covering concepts on combinational and sequential circuits, FSMs, System design using FPGA, and project to be done by the end of internship.

   - This internship is helpful for building my knowledge and skills on VLSI design and also provide project as a practical based learning.


- I have completed my internship on RISC-V and VLSI Design using the mini board at VLSI System Design under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh.

Checkout the repository for more details on the internship
