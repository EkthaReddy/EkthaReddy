<summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>

   Final year student at R.M.K. Engineering College pursuing BE Degree on Electronics and Communication Engineering, maintaing the 8.47 CGPA.
Completed my 10th and 12th education from PM Shri Kendriya Vidyalaya of Ambarnath, Maharashtra. Secured 85.6% and 86.6% respectively.


To provide details about me in brief : 

I am a final year student pursuing ECE with VLSI as major degree. I chose VLSI as my major because it is my true passion and one of my area of interest. 
I have showed my dedication and determination to pursue the area of interest by doing various projects and internships from the same field. 
As for the Internships concern, I completed internships at NSIC, Vlsi System Design, Intershala Trainings and currently doing at Plasmid.
Also, to know the problems society is facing, I had done volunteering at Pledge a Smile organization, where I dedicated myself for fundraising, also participated in social media management and content writing on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram.

Moreover, I have done projects on Robotics doamin too, where I showcased my fundamental knowledge by applying to pratical setting.

   <summary><h4>Projects</h4></summary>

As a VLSI student, my passion was not limited to the verys same domain, I have passion for FPGA, AI, Embedded Systems and AI Tools too.
This led to curiosity by doing various other projects to concentrate more on complex theories and continously improve myself with evolving technologies.

I have done projects on various platforms.
Such as,

- Xilinx Vivado
- Cadence Virtuoso
- LTspice
- Microwind
- Quartus Prime Lite
- ModelSim - Altera
- RISCv Toolchain
- EDA Playground
- Xilinx ISE
- Tinkercad
- Magic

I have demonstrated my ability to work with FPGA boards aswell, to utilize FPGA board I became profiecient with the Xilinx Vivado Suite and Quartus Prime Lite.

I have briefed out the projects I completed below.

### Internship 

<!--
**Ongoing**

- Currently, doing internship at Plasmid for embedded systems.
- Time period: September to October 

**Completed** -->

- Completed intership on VLSI Design at Intershala, covering concepts on combinational and sequential circuits, FSMs, System design using FPGA, and project to be done by the end of internship.

   - This internship is helpful for building my knowledge and skills on VLSI design and also provide project as a practical based learning.
     
- I have completed my internship on RISC-V and VLSI Design using the mini board at VLSI System Design under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh.
