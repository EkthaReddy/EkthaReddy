### Internship 

Currently, I am doing an intership on VLSI Design at Intershala, covering concepts on combinational and sequential circuits, FSMs, System design using FPGA, and project to be done by the end of internship.

This internship is helpful for building my knowledge and skills on VLSI design and also provide project as a practical based learning.


I have completed my internship on RISC-V and VLSI Design using the mini board at VLSI System Design under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh.
