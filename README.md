**Details on projects, Internships, Hacakathons, Symposium, Competition, Certifications, Skills and Extra Curricular Activities :**</summary>

   Final year student at R.M.K. Engineering College pursuing BE Degree on Electronics and Communication Engineering, maintaing the 8.47 CGPA.
Completed my 10th and 12th education from PM Shri Kendriya Vidyalaya of Ambarnath, Maharashtra. Secured 85.6% and 86.6% respectively.


To provide details about me in brief : 

I am a final year student pursuing ECE with VLSI as major degree. I chose VLSI as my major because it is my true passion and one of my area of interest. 
I have showed my dedication and determination to pursue the area of interest by doing various projects and internships from the same field. 
As for the Internships concern, I completed internships at NSIC, Vlsi System Design, Intershala Trainings and currently doing at Plasmid.
Also, to know the problems society is facing, I had done volunteering at Pledge a Smile organization, where I dedicated myself for fundraising, also participated in social media management and content writing on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram.

Moreover, I have done projects on Robotics doamin too, where I showcased my fundamental knowledge by applying to pratical setting.

<details>
   <summary><h3>Projects : All the completed/ongoing projects information are listed below </h3></summary>

As a VLSI student, my passion was not limited to the very same domain, I have passion for FPGA, AI, Embedded Systems and AI Tools too.
This led to curiosity by doing various other projects to concentrate more on complex theories and continously improve myself with evolving technologies.

I have done projects on various platforms.
Which are,

- Xilinx Vivado
- Cadence Virtuoso
- LTspice
- Microwind
- Quartus Prime Lite
- ModelSim - Altera
- RISCv Toolchain
- EDA Playground
- Xilinx ISE
- Tinkercad
- Magic

I have demonstrated my ability to work with FPGA boards aswell, to utilize FPGA board I became profiecient with the Xilinx Vivado Suite and Quartus Prime Lite.

I have briefed out the projects I completed below.
   
<details>
   <summary><h4>Verilog HDL based projects description.</h4></summary>

   I have worked on various types of concepts on verilog programming, ranging from fsm to computer architecture.

These are the projects so far I have worked on, 

- Vending Machine
- Washing Machine
- RISCv Single Cycle Processor
- Hamming Encoder
- Haming Decoder
- SEC-SED Using Hamming technique.

Let's brief it out individually

**What is Vending Machine**

A vending machine is a large self-service, often box-like device that sells small items. You put money or a credit card into the machine, choose what you want to buy by pressing a button or touchscreen, and then the machine gives you the item you selected. Itâ€™s a convenient way to buy things quickly without needing to go to a store or interact with a cashier.

In this project we will be using 5, 10, 20 and 50 ruppee coins to purchase a five ruppee product. It will have five case to represent each transaction that are going to have, i.e.,

Moreover, while purchasing goods, if extra money is inserted the vending machine will return back in 5, 10, 20 ruppee coins as they are readily available with almost everyone.
